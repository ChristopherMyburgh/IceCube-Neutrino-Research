# IceCube-Neutrino-Research
This research investigates the application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for predicting the azimuth and zenith angles of high-energy neutrino events recorded by the IceCube Observatory, a critical task in astrophysics. The study emphasizes a robust data preprocessing pipeline that extracts event-specific features and organizes them into structured arrays while adhering to ethical considerations, including data privacy and compliance with usage policies.

Three RNN architectures—Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and a hybrid model—are evaluated for their effectiveness in predicting event directions. The LSTM model demonstrates strong capabilities in capturing temporal patterns but is hindered by lengthy training times due to hardware limitations. The GRU model, on the other hand, achieves competitive accuracy while offering superior computational efficiency, making it an attractive alternative. The hybrid model, while theoretically innovative, delivers suboptimal performance compared to its counterparts.

The analysis reveals nuanced differences in the models' accuracy and correlation for azimuth and zenith angle predictions, shedding light on their relative strengths and limitations. Hardware constraints emerged as a significant limitation, restricting the number of training batches and the complexity of the models used in this study.

The research contributes to advancing the understanding of RNNs for high-energy neutrino direction prediction, emphasizing ethical data handling and computational performance. It highlights the potential for future exploration of alternative architectures, such as Transformers and ensemble methods, to further enhance predictive accuracy and computational efficiency.
